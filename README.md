## A Comparative Analysis of Modern vs. Traditional Algorithmic Approaches to Sales and Profit Forecasting

This project was my first machine learning project, undertaken as part of my learning journey during a Data Science Bootcamp with WeCloudData.

The research aims to compare the performance of modern methods, including a **Neural Network** and two other complex machine learning algorithms (**Random Forest** and **XGBoost**), against the traditional **Linear Regression** approach for forecasting sales.

The entire process is detailed in the Jupyter notebook and summarized in the accompanying PowerPoint presentation.

The dataset used in this project was the Superstore data from Kaggle: ["Superstore Sales Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditisaxena20/superstore-sales-dataset)
